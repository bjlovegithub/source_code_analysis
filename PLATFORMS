This is a list of platforms which Xapian has been reported to have built
and passed "make check" on.  It will probably work on many more platforms
- lack of an entry here shouldn't be assumed to mean it won't work, just that
we've not had any reports.

The list is getting rather long these days, so to summarise, Xapian should
compile on any fairly modern Unix or Unix-like platform with a compiler
with decent ISO C++ support, except for AIX.  If you're using GCC, 3.1
is the minimum supported version, but you may need a newer version for some
architectures (e.g. 3.3 on ARM).

The only tested compiler we've failed to build with so far is Compaq C++ (see
below for more information).

64 bit platforms are well supported (we do a lot of development work on x86-64
Linux), as are both big and little endian platforms.  Any sane Linux
distribution should work, and we regularly test build on several.

Additionally, Xapian can be built on Microsoft Windows using Cygwin or Mingw
GCC, or with MSVC.  And on OS/2 with EMX GCC.

We have automated builds on all the platforms we can get access to, and users
have submitted the results trying to build Xapian on various other platforms.
The one attempt to build on AIX so far has failed.

If you try a platform not listed here (or try a newer version on a listed
platform) we'd love to hear - please at least include the OS version (e.g.
output from "uname -a"), compiler and version (e.g. output from g++ -v), and
any switches you passed to configure.  Please also run "make check" and
tell us if any tests fail.

Attempts to build Xapian with Compaq's C++ compiler (on Tru64, HPUX, and
Linux) have so far failed.  Older versions of the compiler simply seem
to lack sufficient support for C++ templates.  This minimal testcase fails to
compile:

  #include <xapian/base.h>

  class Query {
    class Internal;
    Xapian::Internal::RefCntPtr<Internal> internal;
    template <class SubQ> Query(SubQ q) : internal(0) { } 
  };

This problem is fixed in Compaq C++ 7.1 (or perhaps earlier), but the build
now fails to link a binary.  Further investigation is required.

These are older reports lacking an update for a more recent Xapian version
(typically because the machine in question was upgraded, or we no longer have
access to it, or the report was from a third party).  We've removed reports
prior to 1.0.0 - so much has changed since then that they're of questionable
value.
